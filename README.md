## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mathieu!
I am a PhD student in computer science at Concordia University.

My research interests include approximate computing, numerical stability, neuroinformatics, and open science. Currently, I am focused on accelerating 3D MRI registration algorithms through the use of mixed-precision techniques.

I am currently a developper for [Nipoppy](https://github.com/nipoppy/nipoppy) and [Boutiques](https://github.com/boutiques/boutiques/).
